Possible Uses:
	network perusing and media acquisition
	data CD archival and indexing
	tree synchronization
	detecting virus changes to executables

Features:
	network and local volume scanning
	file searching by name, date range, size range, type
	file filtering by the same atttributes
	file queueing and copying
	view by tree, single level list, recursive list
	view ordered by name, date, size
	topology refreshing to see file additions/deletions
	storing, reloading, importing of topologies
	exporting topology to HTML or tab delimited text
	volume recognization by volume number
	tree comparison

List Key:
	green plus - new file, not found last scan
	blue plus - file changed, size or date different
	red x - deleted/moved/renamed since last scan
	yellow x - unknown error accessing object
	yellow lock - permission denied (must be passworded)
	red barred circle - ignored/banned object

Local area networks can be HUGE, especially when people share their whole hard drive. Archived CD collections can be just as large.
So this program supports up to 100,000 file entries, which is more than twice sufficient for the OSU campus LAN, and plenty sufficient for every file I've ever archived.

I wrote this after using the program LanScan by Marek Dulko (v2.1.1).
It was good for making a large list, but lacked some features I and a few of my housemates wanted.
The newest LanScan does more, but this is a good excuse to learn something new (or maybe I'm too cheap to pay a mere $15).

Given enough time, it can record the entire network topology.
Then, the next time you run it, it will refresh and show any changes in its contents.
It was designed specifically for and tested with MS Windows Networking, but it might be able to access other kinds of networks.

Before attempting to access a machine's shares, the program attempts to connect to that machine using Winsock (TCP connection on port 139).
This prevents the retardly long 1-2 minute stall WNetOpenEnum causes upon accessing computers that are residually shown in a workgroup but have actually been turned off or are temporarily down.
