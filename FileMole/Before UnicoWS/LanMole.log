2003-01-22	Made LAN list dynamic, to use ptr to ordered array.
			Added error icon overlay.

2003-01-23	Added toolbar with test images
			Toolbar and status bar now resize themselves
			Added calculation of other main window child controls
2003-01-25  Added main window size calculation when dialog panels are active

2003-01-26  Fixed tab problem (Windows bug) with multiline edits in the dialog panel
2003-03-02	Ignore key accelerators on repeat
			Create attribute list class for new expected dialog panel
2003-03-03	Give attribute list basic components, push button, toggle button, and text edit

2003-05-11  Fixed dialog panel and toolbar buttons problems for XP
2003-05-17  Scans network using Unicode (now Yoshi's folders are finally accessible)
            Will scan using ANSI if Unicode not supported
            Scans file using Unicode too, using ANSI if Unicode not available
2003-05-24  Added file and network enumeration to scanning thread. The paths are hard coded for now.
			Added ScanLanItemAdded to check for space and allocate a slot for a new entry
			Thought of a fast way to check new files with existing files in the list using name checksums.
			Wrote a test program to graph the distribution of name values, and tweaked with the algorithm until they were nicely spread out
2003-05-25	Added name checksummer after much chagrine and wasted time from realizing Win95 does not support many Unicode functions.
			Now properly enumerates everything: networks, workgroups, servers, shares, folders, files, local drives
2003-05-27  Tried to add images to the menus, but Windows does not correctly support them. They must be bitmaps, instead of the more useful icons. It draws all the colors wrong
			Tried to make owner drawn menus but MS makes it difficult because the measure item message does not even tell you the handle of the menu being measured. How useless is that?
			Plus, it frees the menu text string as soon as you set it owner drawn, so your drawing code prints only a null string. ):-/
			Corrected unlikely but potential stray pointer problem that could have happened if the thread switch occurred right between chaining the old entry and creating the new entry
			Verified that all Unicode enumeration works correctly in XP.
			Learned that XP will only enumerate workgroups if the network is specified (since there is more than one network). Otherwise NetProv=null is the same as the NetRsc=null.
			Fixed distortion of icons in attribute list which was never apparent 95, only XP.
2003-05-28	//Set container flag for all container items
			Added date/time to all enummed items, last modified date/time to files and last access to network objects
			//Moved window classes into their respective files, moved toolbar, tooltip data structures around
			Skips all temporary and offline files (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY or FILE_ATTRIBUTE_OFFLINE) but seems to do nothing on Win95/FAT because those attributes are never set
			Skips silly . and .. entries but allows filenames starting with a period, since they are common in Unix (.addressbook)
			Numeric attribute fields now allow only numbers
			Handles a few more potential network error messages
2003-05-29  Added About dialog which grabs info from version resource, so always current. Sets label bold.
2003-06-22  Increased name buffer size because it was becoming full with 32000 names.
2003-06-23  Changed all LAN list and attribute list icons to ImageList bitmaps - much better!
2003-06-24  Improved appearance of all LAN list iccns, borrowing from XP's shell.
2003-06-28	Added neat little tooltips and messages to all the menu choices. Difficult >_<
			Added context sensitive help option (help tips).
2003-06-29	Help tips: Improved placement to support popup menus, submenus, system menu, children's menus, windows, toolbar buttons, and manual position by children.
			Attribute list: Added help tip based on selected or hovered choice.
			Attribute list: Popup menu responds Apps key and relay menu selections to parent window for help tips.

			add, icons to all attribute list actions.
			add, attribute list title separator bars, with rounded rectangle in background.
2003-08-05  chg, Attribute list and Lan list selection colors, to match those of the system list control.
			imp, FINALLY figured out how to get stupid Windows IME to give my program Unicode characters. GetCompositionString does NOT work right. Must register class using W and must call DefWindowProcW.
			chg, discared all the dialog panels and replaced with pure attribute lists :( Lots of work not put to use, but better overall - definitely easier to work with.
			imp, attribute list and LAN list accept typed Unicode characters.
2003-08-10  fix, ToolBar/AttributeList transparency problem with 32bit color displays.
			add, mouse wheel scrolling to LAN list.

2003-08-12  chg, renamed FLanScan to LanMole.

			add, AL keeps selection in view and scrolls if necessary when using arrow keys.

			imp, AL edit redraws upon editing and caret movement.
2003-08-21	fix, double resize of items when minimized/maximized.

			imp, AL mouse cursor not resetting hovered item when new list set.
			imp, AL shows/hides edit when items selected or when focus changes.
			imp, AL repositions and shows/hides when list scrolled.

2003-08-26	fix, help tooltip placement over attribute list few pixels off
			add, no help available message for items with no help text, instead of turning off the tooltip
			imp, AL supports copy & paste for stupid old ANSI 9x systems. Interestingly, IE4+ copies and pastes text as Unicode even on 9x systems.
			imp, AL left/right/space keys change a toggle buttons value
			imp, AL menu button displays menu of all choices (not positioned correctly yet)
			add, include support for filtering drive types

			fix, AL overlay not redrawing itself when pasting text of exact same size

2003-08-29	chg, AL removed useless file item type
			add, AL custom context menu options by parent's whim (open file, browse folder...)
2003-08-30	fun, added code to display certain shell icons and even destroy the global image list if desired (yeah! explorer with no icons)
2003-08-31	fix, disallow help tooltip to be off screen
2003-09-01	fix, improve help tooltip placement for menu items
			add, added webpage, email, and readme buttons to About dialog
			chg, moved all contact info and program version/date info into resource header, so a single text change would update everything

			add, LAN list scroll with Ctrl+arrow keys
			add, GetLanListOsPath function
2003-09-20	add, LAN list (Ctrl+left click) or Space toggles selection
			chg, LAN list separated text formatting into separate function instead of in WM_PAINT
			add, cheap hack to export indented list of all scanned files (temporary)
			fix, AL title font was often too small because TEXTMETRIC and LOGFONT used different heights.
2003-09-22	add, log sizer and panel sizer have movement limits
			chg, AL toggle will only toggle when clicking on nonbutton part if already has focus
2003-09-24	add, servers are connected to via socket before attempting to read shares, to prevent two minute lockup while waiting for the dumb DLL to respond.

Still need:

fix toolbar and status bar visibility
check GetFileInformationByHandle with drives and volumes for date (maybe NT only)
investigate NetServerEnum instead of EnumNetResource
add search opposite attributes (like NOT hidden, or NOT system)
add search for new files/not new files
add search for object type
add insert object type
add description to server
add list action to open two branches if only one container child exists
add correct order by number
add full redraw for resize bars
order the g before s in this case
\\ANIMAL\MP3\Aerosmith - Same Old Song And Dance.mp3
\\ANIMAL\MP3\Aerosmith-Girls_Of_Summer.mp3
ignore dumb shared docs
check if get permissions is valid, if so ignore any drives with write permission
exclude download*.dat C D Windows

check if error msgs different on XP
add passwords to resource access (WNetAddConnection2)
test if temp file flag actually even set on NTFS
fill LAN list with items
implement LAN list expand/collapse
draw details in LAN list
order lan list according to name/date/size

Maybe:
add option to delete all excluded files from list
add minimize/restore to dialog panel
add icons to menu options

Nah:
use drawgradient function for AL title bars


// to invoke properties on item
SHELLEXECUTEINFO sei;

   ZeroMemory(&sei,sizeof(sei));
   sei.cbSize = sizeof(sei);
   sei.lpFile = szPathOfFileToLaunchPropertiesOf;
   sei.lpVerb = "properties";
   sei.fMask  = SEE_MASK_INVOKEIDLIST;
   ShellExecuteEx(&sei);
