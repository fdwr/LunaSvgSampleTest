#D This rule is a cross between Life and Brian's Brain.
#D The basic idea is that the cells are divided between
#D dark "sea" cells and light "land" cells.
#D 
#D We run Brain in the sea, and on land we run not Life but
#D AntiLife. Six or seven firing Brain cells turn a sea cell into land.
#D Seven "antifiring" Antilife cells turn a land cell into sea.
#D 
#D A rule by Rudy Rucker.
