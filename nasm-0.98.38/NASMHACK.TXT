This IS NOT an official release of NASM. I prefer you do not redistribute it.
It is just my personal hack with very minor changes to make compiling my GUI
a little easier.

Hacks:
-DW inserts Unicode strings instead of word aligned bytes
-Recognizes C preprocesser form (accepts %define or #define)
-Recognizes '//' as comments (in addition the usual ';')

Why:
-So I can easily use Unicode strings with: dw "Some Word",0
 instead of resorting to: dw 'S','o','m','e',' ','W','o','r','d',0
-So the same header file can be used in both the ASM parts, the C code, and
 in the resource file.

Hopes:
-Would like to see these or similar changes in the official build
-Would like to support multiline comments, but that would take a much deeper
 understanding of the project flow.
