Last updated 2008-12-09. These goals have been moved to a different project.

What it is:
- A flexible tilemap archival utility, for making maps like you saw in Nintendo Power years ago.
- Raw data viewer, able to view uncompressed byte arrays and graphics.
- Structured data viewer, given a pattern definition.

What it is *not*:
- Not a beginner's tool (you should know what a hex editor is and hopefully have written at least some software).
- Not a map editor. If you need a tool for making your hobby tile-based game, use Mappy, Tile Studio, or RPG toolkit.
- Not a game editing/hacking tool. So you have this great idea for a custom Mario World... look Lunar elsewhere.

Definitely:
- Arbitrary tilemap size 1x1 to ?x? of variable unit bitsizes (1bit - 32bit)
- Rectangular tilemaps, wrapped segmented tilemaps, block segment tilemaps
- Tilemap wrapping and clamping
- Composite tile tables (subtiles)
- Multiple image sets (supporting linear 8bit, 32bit, bitplane 4bit, 8bit...)
- Variable tile size 1x1 to 128x128 (including non-powers of two)
- Multiple overlaid tilemaps per scene
- Indexed/truecolor tiles
- Multiple palettes
- Palette per scene or per tilemap
- Palette offset per tile; palette offset per tilemap
- Image set offset per tilemap
- Variable tilemap unit size (4bit to 32bit)
- Z layer per tilemap and per tile
- Single image set per tilemap
- Horizontal/vertical flip per tile
- Rotation per tile
- Any orientation per tilemap, per subtile entry
- Draw to 8bit target or true color palette
- Layer blending effects (add, sub, half-alpha, multiply)
- Importing linear/planar graphics (lsb/msb)

Later:
- Draw scaled view (for overview or zoom)
- Rotation (mode 7 transform) for sprites and bgs
- Annotations and links/shortcuts
- Sprites
- Parallax
- Tile animation
- State/switches (like after a fire or earthquake or switch changes the water level)

Maybe:
- Isometric/Hex (shift per odd x,y)
- Z layer per pixel
- Offset per tile (Starfox uses it, investigate Strike Gunner and Puzzle Bobble)

Types:
Scene - contains multiple layers
Tilemap - contains multiple tiles, uses tileset, palette, optional tileset table
Tilemap instance - placement of a tilemap in scene
Tileset - contains multiple tiles
Graphics - contains multiple images/tiles/sprites
Scene group - grouping of tilemaps and sprites in scene
Sprite - graphic character, maybe frame animated
Sprite instance - placement of a sprite in scene
Palette - color set
Link - link to another location (or state change, some are specially marked, entry/exit)
Annotation - textual information
Path - animation path for sprites or bgs (linear, cubic)
Arrow - to illustrate expected path
Tilemap splice - modification of another tilemap
Raw binary data - could be raw WRAM, VRAM, ROM data...
Walkthrough - sequence of links and annotations
