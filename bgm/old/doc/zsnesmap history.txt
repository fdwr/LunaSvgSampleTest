5  Start writing viewer
   Figure out where certain registers of the SNES were stored in ZSNES savestates
8  Write code for simple GUI parts
11 Create main menu and fileload window
13 Add mouse support (it was a must)  
14 Able to load VRAM, OAM, and scroll registers
   but not able to display even a single tile yet
18 Get the scene info page right after some trial and error
   Tells the tile size, map size, and scroll registers
19 Add palette viewing window
22 Write a tile translator (SNES tile => linear bitmap)
23 Try to figure out how tilemaps are arranged with simple colored blocks
   They are messed up! Instead of 64x64 tilemaps being normal, simple arrays
   they are four 32x32 tilemaps.
24 Replace the blocks with real tiles (at least for non-mode 7 8x8 tiles)
   Add palette colormapping
25 Replace the tilemap debugger with the real one to draw scene layers
   Add sprites list with details (they might not be right though)
26 Get the tilemaps to wrap correctly!
27 Add View scene scroll with arrow keys
28 Beat Mario RPG and decide I want to make a map of it.
   Maybe ZsnesMapper will someday do what it was made to do and make a map
   of it along with Zelda.
29 Lost copy I've been working on for a week and start from backup
31 Added mode 7 tiles

1998-09 (Sept)
1  Map tiles are now flipped vertically and horizontally
2  File loader is actually functional now
3  Added mosaic, vertical scan line, and cycle count info
   verified that other games can be viewed with it
8  Start to add sprites (to the Sprites page at least, not the scene)
9  Get my old copy back!
