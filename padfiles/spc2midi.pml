			<Char_Desc_2000>Spc2Midi can play the songs from Super Nintendo games, display the musical information, allow you to assign properties to the sounds, and export the song to MIDI format to use music authoring programs and electronic keyboards. The reason I wrote this was so I could see the notes to play them on my keyboard (since playing by ear takes a lot of trial and error). Two other useful alternatives exist (SpcTool by AntiRes and a converter by Gigo), but neither of them support immediate song seeking or have enough automated audio analysis features.</Char_Desc_2000>
