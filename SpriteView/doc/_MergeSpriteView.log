==================================
Compiling (for those that want to)
==================================
  SpriteView was written in assembly and compiled with Nasm 0.97 and WdosX 0.95. The code consists of four files, sv.asm, sv.mac, sv.inc, and svtile.asm. The macro file contains all the definitions and macros used. Sv.asm is the main program, the include file contains all the little subroutines called by the main program, and Svtile.inc contains the tile converting routines and bitplane format patterns. There are also two other include files from Gaz's library used for memory allocation and system exiting, memory.inc and system.inc.

  In addition to the code, there are three data files, one for the font and the other two for default VGA and rainbow palettes.

  The tile converting routine is as fast as I know how to get it, timed with several other variations. I'm welcome to info on how it could be faster if an assembly expert out there saw how. Anybody is free to use it for their own viewer or whatever, just as long they include my name in the credits (of course it is not like I can do anything about it if isn't). Any other routines in my code may also be used for your progs as long you don't say wrote them yourself; after all, assembly is tedious work :-)

  Here are some web-sites to find WdosX, Nasm or Gaz's complete library.

History (for those that care :-)
================================
	Discovered the world of emulation and download two tile viewers (Naga and X-char)
	Read a little in various docs about how SNES images are stored as 8x8 tiles
	Downloaded example Basic code from VileWrath's page - finally get an example! :-)
--0.0-- (1998)
Feb 8	Write my own qb viewer
	Add 1,2, & 4 bitplane format
	Add a gray palette
--0.1--
	Added some much needed scrolling ability and Goto
	Interleaved the tile drawing with retrieving of key input
	Waiting for the entire screen to fill up before you could move was just too slow
	Added the ability to change the viewing wrap width, for unusual length strips
	Discovered 8bit arrangement (used in Mario AllStars title and selection screen)
	Rewrote the gray palette to be dynamic and added inverse gray
--0.2--
	Added plane separation, and exclusion
	Discovered bitmode 3 used by many ROMs (including my favorite Zelda)
	Talk to author of Sneese about 3bpl
	He says that sprites only use 4bpl (so the games must convert them first)
	Sent the 3bpl and correct 8bit format to Magnus Runesson (author of Smc-Ripper)
	Implemented a pointer table to reduce redundant code, instead of a separate routine for each bitmode and such
--0.3--
	Inlcuded a generic file loading prompt, with directory listing ability
	Added the most important palette yet, palettes from snapshots of a game
	Able to import screenshot palettes from GIF, PCX or bitmap images
	Threw together a simple (but effective) palette editing screen
	Let the user save the edited palettes to PAL files and reload them
	Added the ability to save the current window (whatever bitmode) to a PCX file
	Find the helpful Corsair+Kari doc long after I actually needed it
	Finally added mode 7 format after putting it off
	Added two useful false color palettes for 256 color modes
	Put in a row alignment to see if it would help with some shifted images
--0.4--
May 10	Put the color overwrite/swap toggle in the palette editor
	Added manual RGB value entry in palette editor
	Sped up the code even more with a little assembly - 9x or so  (:-)
	  (the whole thing should probably be assembly though)
--1.0--
Nov 3	Start working on assembly version 1.0
	Implement scrolling, different bitmodes, and gray palette
	Test SV against Naga with pleasing speed results
Nov 4	Add cool rainbow palette and variable window width
	Change palette selection to cycle among the four generic ones
	Write this readme
Nov 5	Clean up code somewhat for anybody reading it
	Add several new sections to the readme (like the tiles info part)
	Add inverse gray palette and change rainbow palette to be dynamic
	(try the invgray with Metroid 3, or the rainbow palette with All-Stars)
	Search for an hour for any info on Genesis's tile format, but no luck
	Write hack for NES tiles and 8x16 mode, but not implemented into public version
Nov 6	Get at least one format of Genesis tiles to appear, but there seem to 
	be others that aren't displayed right
	First public release
