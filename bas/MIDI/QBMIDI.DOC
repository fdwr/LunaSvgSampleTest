Hello and welcome to QBMIDI.  If you use MIDI and you program using
Microsoft QuickBASIC or BASIC PDS, then we're confident you'll love the
QBMIDI library, since it gives you to access and control your MIDI'ed
instruments using simple QuickBASIC compatible calls.  QBMIDI V1.0 is a
fully functional library of utilities that provide you with access to
all of your MIDI instruments connected through a Roland MPU401 or
compatible MIDI interface.  You can play your instruments via QuickBASIC
as well as receive MIDI information and send MIDI commands to your MIDI'ed
instruments.  It's simple, fast, and best of all ... you'll be in 
control of your MIDI instruments! 

Included with this document file (QBMIDI.DOC), you'll find the following
related files:

     QBM-DEM1.BAS     Initial demonstration program that features a few
                      simple MIDI commands and general starting place

describe usage within the source code of the demo programs.  We encourage
experimentation with the demo programs to gain a better understanding while
having some fun.


FOR NEW QUICKBASIC PROGRAMMERS
------------------------------
For new programmers, like we were at one time,we've tried to aim our examples
at your level.  QuickBASIC's library and sub functions can be somewhat tricky
at first, so we've listed what you should type to get the libraries loaded 
and running.  If you're a pro at QuickBASIC please excuse the lengthy 
descriptions, as we want everyone to get to make music as fast as possible 
with the least amount of problems.


USING QBMIDI WITHIN THE QUICKBASIC PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT (QB.EXE)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Two libraries are provided with QBMIDI, one called QBMIDI.QLB (the Quick
Library) and QBMIDI.LIB (the Linkable library).  When working within the
QuickBASIC programming environment (ie. using QB.EXE), you have the option
to load a QuickLibrary at the time you start QB.EXE.  We make use of this
feature to enables you to use all of QBMIDI call routines while debugging
your programs.

To start QuickBASIC with QBMIDI library functions available you would type
the following:

     QB /L QBMIDI <Enter>

Note: The file QBMIDI.QLB should be placed in the same directory with your
      other QB library files (typically the same directory where the file
      QB.EXE is found).  You may also start QB.EXE with QBMIDI by adding
      the pathname where to find QBMIDI.QLB (ie. QB /L Pathname\QBMIDI)

If when starting QB.EXE you receive this error message:

     Cannot find file (QBMIDI.QLB). Input path:

you may type in a new path name, but we recommend control ^C and re-entering
a correct pathname from startup.  By doing this now, you'll save time when
compiling your programs to .EXE executable's.

If you are greeted with the Microsoft QuickBASIC environment, without seeing
any error messages, you can assume that QBMIDI.QLB was loaded and its 
functions are available.  For some reason QuickBASIC doesn't tell you what 
library is loaded of if the load went OK so we just say no news is good news.


WITHIN THE QUICKBASIC PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT
---------------------------------------------

To use any of the QBMIDI commands, you simply call the command as you would
a local SUB function.  Don't worry if you don't know how to use SUB's since
QBMIDI does not use the SUB capabilities, but is merely called like one.
For example:

     Any good midi program should first check to see if an MPU401 controller
     is present, connected, and ready for data.  To find out we use the
     QBMIDI SeeIfMPUExists command.  The full QuickBASIC call syntax is:

     CALL SeeIfMPUExists(Found)	

When run, the QBMIDI.QLB library function named SeeIfMPUExists is called and
returns a value in the variable called Found.  SeeIfMPUExists returns the
value of zero (0) for no MPU found and -1 indicating an MPU was located.

NOTE: If you receive the message Subprogram Not Found, this indicates you've
not loaded QB using the /L option.  See the examples above and restart QB.EXE.

Each QBMIDI command functions in this same way, with one exception. Some
commands require that you set the variables values before calling.  For
example:

     If playing a note, we us the PlayNote command with the following
     syntax.
     
     Note=60                           'Middle C
     Velocity = 64                     'Moderate strike velocity
     CALL PlayNote (Note,Velocity)     'Use QBMIDI playnote to play

In the above example, the values were set before calling the routine.  The 
following table lists the QBMIDI command and a quick description of how it 
is used. 

CALL STATEMENT                 SEND/RETURNED
--------------                 ---------------------------------------------
CALL SeeIfMPUExists(Found)     Found = 0 if no MPU is found
                               Found = -1 if MPU is found and ready

CALL ResetMpu                  Resets the MPU to power on state. No variable
                               is given or returned. Use sparingly to reset
                               MPU if another program modifies it.  This will
                               not stop notes in play. Use AllNotesOff.

CALL SetDataInStopMode         Turns off some of the MPU's intelligence.
                               No variable is sent or returned.

Note = n                       Note to play. Range 0 to 127 where 60=Middle C
Velocity = n                   Strike velocity. Range 0 to 127 where 1=soft
                               127=hardest, and 0= turn note off.
CALL PlayNote(Note, Velocity)  Plays a Note, passes variables Note, Velocity
                               To turn note off, pass note number with the
                               velocity set at zero (0). Note and velocity
                               variables are left unchanged after call.

CALL AllNotesOff               All notes off currently playing turned off.
                               No variable is sent or returned.

NewPatch = n                   Patch number to change to, range 0 - 127
CALL ChangePatchTo (NewPatch)  Change the patch (voice) currently in use
                               to New Patch number given. NewPatch variable
                               is left unchanged after the call.

CALL ReceiveMidiData(Value)    Receive any midi data that may be coming
                               in from synthesizers or keyboards. Several
                               midi bytes may be sent in succession, so
                               your routines should be ready to catch all
                               that are sent.  See QBM-DEM2.BAS for more.

CALL OmniModeOn                Turn on Omni, where all MIDI data will be
                               played by all synthesizer channels. No 
                               variables are passed or returned.
CALL OmniModeOff               Set Omni Off, where MIDI channel data is
                               only received by the synthesizer's channel. No 
                               variables are passed or returned.
CALL SetToPolyMode             Set multi-voice mode. No variables are passed
                               or returned.
CALL SetToMonoMode             Set to Mono-voice mode. No variables are 
                               passed or returned.

COMPILING PROGRAMS FROM QUICKBASIC SO THEY CAN USE QBMIDI
---------------------------------------------------------

One nice feature within QuickBASIC is its ability to compile your program
to a standalone or runtime .EXE file and use the library you started with.
Since you started QB using the /L QBMIDI command, Quick-BASIC will 
automatically use the QBMIDI.LIB (run version of QBMIDI) file when it 
compiles your program.

To compile you're program, use Alt select, Run, Make EXE file.  Your screen
should resemble the following.  Select Make EXE and Exit and QuickBASIC will
compile your program and exit.  To run the example below after compile, you
type QBM-DEM1 <Enter>.
