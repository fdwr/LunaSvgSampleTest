---What is this?-------------------------------------------------------------

    The purpose this was written for was to make it possible to send pictures
  and other types of binary data through mail that only allows text and no
  attachments. It was originally written for me and a friend who both have
  Juno, which although it is free, can only transfer text. The way it gets
  around this is by converting the binary data (a full 8bits) into text,
  sending the translated text (which looks like ASCII static to a person),
  and then converting it back into its original form on the other side. The
  mail program does not even know it's been aced. Now maybe some of you that
  have limited access to the net, but possibly have your own computer at home
  with just simple text email can get some use out of it too.
    It supports both 7bit text for a better size ratio, and 6bit text for
  those whose email servers sqwauk at any extended characters. For example,
  Juno will state that a file can not be inserted into your message if it
  contains any extended characters at all (ASCII 128-255)*. 6bit outputs
  8 characters of text for every 6 bytes of data. 7bit outputs 8 characters
  of text for every 7 bytes of data, getting a little less expansion.

  * There is a way to get around the annoying dialog box that prevents you
  from using extended characters. Simply load your converted text into Write
  or Notepad, 'Select All', 'Copy', and then 'Paste' it into your message
  using the 'Edit' menu. Another way of outsmarting your mail program if it
  does not like weird characters is to directly append the converted text to
  your Outbox, which in Juno's case would be 'C:\JUNO\USER0000\FOLD0001.FRM'.
    This would also work with NetScape's 'C:\NETSCAPE\MAIL\OUTBOX' but of
  course if you have NetScape, then you probably also have email attachments.
    Bty, 'FOLD0000.FRM' is the Inbox, so if you want to retrieve an embed
  directly from it instead of saving to a separate file, just have BinText
  look in there. It will find the embed in probably just few a seconds; then
  you just select it from the list embeds found.

---The files-----------------------------------------------------------------

  BinText.Bas - Qb program for converting binary data into text and appending
    it to a text file. That text file can either then be inserted into your
    message by saving the text to a separate file and importing it, or by
    appeding it directly to the mailer's outbox.
  TextBin.Bas - Program for converting recieved text back into its binary
    data so you can look at the picture, listen to the MIDI, or whatever.
    The source text can be either a separate file or the mailer's Inbox and
    can contain many embeds (up to 30). When it is done searching for them
    and compiling the list, just select the one you want.
  Convert.Asm - Source code to assembly routines for all the encoding and
    decoding, for both 6&7bit. It uses 32bit registers for some extra speed.

    The two converting programs are separate for now because it was simply
  easier to do, but they will eventually be merged into one program that can
  do both jobs.


---A litte bit about Embeds--------------------------------------------------

    Each complete embed must have an opening '==EmbedBegin==' and a closing
  '==EmbedEnd==' for the piece to be recognized. Embeds are only ended by the
  closing bracket or EOF, so blank lines can be included without messing up
  the data. Between these two brackets is all the data and the header that
  goes with the data. The average header contains four entries for decoding.


---Supported header entries------------------------------------------------

  Name
    A name to call this data piece by, not the same a filename. It can be a
    short a description. May be absent.
  File
    The default filename to use for this data embed. Technically it does not
    need to be present since the user can enter a different one anyway, but
    it is needed to identify an embed as a continuation from a previous part.
 *Part
    Identifies the part of a larger file that an embed is. It may be absent
    from small single part files. For the last part, a 'last' suffix is added.
    This could also include a fileposition after each part number to verify
    that this piece is being output the right place in the destination file.
  Encoding
    How the data is stored, what method was used to translate it to text, and
    how to translate it back into binary. If absent, TextBin will not know
    what to do.
    Supported encodings include:
      shited,6bit,base64   (similar to the one used in MIME but not the same)
      shifted,7bit,base128 (never seen this one before)
  Data
    The most important entry; without it, you don't have an embed. The entry
    can simply introduce the data or include the data size in bytes. If there
    is a difference between the amount of data output to the destination file
    and the bytes listed after the entry, a warning will be given.

  * Currently bintext only supports single part messages, so your file
  whatever it is, must be less than the limit your email program allows per
  letter. With Juno, that limit is 61k. Anything more than that will not fit.

    The name and file can be left out without any loss; however the encoding
  and data must be included or else you do not have a complete embed. The
  filename and part number are necessary for multipart files that have been
  split up into more than one letter. It needs to know the filename to be
  sure which embed is a continuation to prior piece


---Examples------------------------------------------------------------------

==EmbedBegin==
Name: c:\dw\bas\blanktsr.com, 06-10-1998
File: blanktsr.Com
Encoding: shifted,6bit,base64

==EmbedEnd==

    This is absolute minimum that an embed must have to be decoded. No name,
  filename, or part number.

==EmbedBegin==
Encoding: shifted,7bit,base128
Data: 486

    TextBin can actually read any file for embeds, including this one. Try it
  out on the two embeds. blanktsr.com is a TSR that can clear the text screen
  by pressing the left shift key. No matter what program is active (assuming
  the prog does not take control of the keyboard completely over) BlankTsr
  can clear the screen. It is sort of neat to see how various progs redraw
  their screen displays. You can not unload it once loaded though unless you
  restart your computer or try it out in a Windows shell, so that when you
  exit the shell, it is automatically removed. The other one is just a little
  bitmap saying 'hello'.

  improvements that could be made to it, please tell me :-)
