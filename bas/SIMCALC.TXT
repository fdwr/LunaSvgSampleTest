ÄAbout
 Written by Dwayne Robinson using QBASIC
 Ver 1.0, started May 1995, completed July 1995
ÄGeneral Notes
 This is only a simple calculator, nothing advanced. It was only created
 to demostrate how a real calculator works. You can use it in live or
 indirect mode. Press TAB to switch between these them.
ÄHow to work it
 You need two operands (or numbers) and an operator for any equation.
 Enter the first operand, the operator, and then last operand.
 Once the equation is set up, you can press Enter or "=" to complete it,
 or you can continue the equation by simply pressing another operator.
 You can store one number to memory and recall that number from memory
 Some operations such as Integer and Square root are single operations
 and do not require an entire equation.
ÄNecessary keys
 You can use the following keys for different operations:
  BkSpc - Cuts the last of digit of current operand in live mode
          Cuts the last character of the string in indirect mode
  Enter - Enters the equation in both modes
  Ctrl+ - Wipes the entire operand or equation in live mode
  BkSpc   Wipes the entire string in indirect mode
  Tab   - Switches between the two modes, direct and indirect
  Esc   - Quits the calcultor at any time
