        Thanks for trying out Lianne in... The Dark Crown.  This version of
  the game is only the beginning however.  I programmed this in Qbasic to
  prove a point: Good, quality software CAN be written in Qbasic.  I hope
  you agree with me that this game proves that point.  As always, any
  comments on this and my other programs are more than welcome.  you can
  e-mail me at these addresses:

                             Setting up the Game

        Here is what you need to have and what you need to do in order to
  make this game run smoothly on your system.

  1. Make sure that all of the game's files are in the same directory and
     that you are in that directory.

  2. Make sure that you have QBASIC.EXE and it is in a directory which is
     in your path statement or it is in the same directory as this game.
  
  3. Before you first play the game, you must run the SETUP.BAS file so
     that the game will run at the proper speed on your system.

  4. Once this is done, you can play the game.  You should play the game
     from DOS mode and you should make sure that you are in the directory
     where all of the game files are located.  This game will run in Win3.1
     or Win95 but it is best under DOS.

  5. Finally, if you are experiencing any problems, then feel free to
     contact the author at darkdread@geocities.com for any help.

        
        If you are still reading, here is an explanation of what's missing
  from the Qbasic version of this game (Qbasic DOES have it's limits, but
  they are greatly distorted by anti-Basic people) and what will be added
  in the final version in QuickBasic 4.5:

       * More enemies, more graphics, more magic, more items, and 4
         more level maps.

       * More storyline sequences.

       * A bigger and better help file with stats on all of the
         enemies and spells.

       * In game options, items, ability to sell weapons, armor, and
         items.

       * Soundblaster music and digitized sound effects (choice of
         either during gameplay).

       * A Keyboard ISR plus gamepad support.  Possibly mouse support
         as well.

        Well, that should be everything I'll put in the game.  Right now I
  don't know if I'll be releasing the QB source code when it is finished.
  I've been thinking about making the final version commercial software
  with a price of $5.00 or $10.00 dollars for it, but I'm not sure yet; if
  I could get some feedback on this it would be great.  So far, here are
  the options I've come up with for the final version, let me know which
  one you think is the best, or if you have a better idea.

       * Port the Qbasic source code of LiTDC Version 1.00 to Quick-
         Basic, compile it, and make it the shareware version then sell
         the full version.  you would have an option to send $5.00
         through the mail and recieve your copy through e-mail or send
         $10.00 and recieve it through snail mail on disk /w manual. A
         manual would cost $2.50 or so for e-mail customers.

       * Release the full QuickBasic version as freeware in .EXE format
         and give an option to buy the QuickBasic 4.5 source code for
         about $20.00 which would give the buyer rights to use routines
         from the game in their own programs as long as credit and
         proof of registration was given.

       * Release the whole thing as freeware, source code and .EXE's,
         with a suggested $5.00 donation which would give the buyer a
         printed manual and hint book.

        There it is.  I think the idea that works best is either 1 or 3.
  But since this program has taken lots of time and effort for me to
  complete, it would be nice to be rewarded for my efforts.  Only I'm not
  sure wether this game will be worth the registration price, even
  though it's small.  So the fate of the final version rests in the air.
  It will be completed, but if it will be shareware, freeware, or what, I
  don't know yet.  I need to know what you, the gamer, thinks is the best
  choice so please send in your input, and ofcourse, let me know what you
  think of the game.  Thanks.
