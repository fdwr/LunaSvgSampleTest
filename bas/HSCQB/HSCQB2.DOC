HSCHSCQB V2.0 QuickBasic HSC player, 1994-1997 by Steve Bigras.
----------------------------------------------------------------

 WHAT'S NEW ?

  Some fixes such as: -Better handling for FM resetting under Windows.

  -Added DFM support!!
  -New options added:
     -You can change instruments with a note with the new tracker I provided.
     -Song name
     -Initial tempo

     **These features are not compatible with the old HSC routines and those
       from Chicken's (HSCOBJ) for Assembler, C++ and Pascal.

  -A small library I made, the FM timings are much more accurate and optimized
   the file HSC.ASM contains the full assembler source. *No secrets :)*
  -File DFM2HSC.BAS is provided with the package if you wish to see how it
   works.

  -FINALLY!! A better tracker, a lot better than the last version, check it
   out! Files needed for FMTracker 2.0: FMTRK2.EXE, 2HSC.EXE, FMTRACK.BNK


  To load the library you must have QuickBasic 4.0 or 4.5
  the syntax is: QB /LHSC



  DECLARE SUBs:
  --------------

          SUB: LoadHSC (Filename$)
  Description: Load a HSC file in memory
      Example: LoadHSC "neointro.hsc"

          SUB: Playtune ()
  Description: SUB routine to play the music once loaded and the ResetFMChip
               has been called.
      Example: DO
               A$ = INKEY$
               IF A$ <> "" THEN EXIT DO
               Playtune
               LOOP

          SUB: Playnote (Chn%, Note%)
  Description: Play a pitch using channel (Chn) and (Note) must be an integer
               from 0-97.  SetInst (Chn%,InstNum%) must be called first.
      Example: SetInst 0,4     'Set instrument #4 in Channel 0
               Playnote 0,50   'Plays pitch 50 at channel 0

          SUB: ResetFMChip (Bits%)
  Description: Resets adlib registers and/or shuts off all channels
     Examples: ResetFMChip 1   'Resets adlib registers
               ResetFMChip 1   'Shuts off channels
               ResetFMChip 1+2 'Resets adlib registers and shuts off channels

          SUB: SetInst (Chn, InstNum%)
  Description: Once a HSC has been loaded, you can set any of the file's
               instrument to a channel, this fonction is automatically used
               when a HSC is loaded. You may use this fonction is you wish
               to use the Playnote command to play sound effects while a HSC
               is playing...

          SUB: Outport (A%, B%)
  Description: This is used to send data in the DATA and register ports of the
               adlib.  There is no need to use this SUB.

ResetFMChip 3
LoadHSC "test.hsc"     'Assume you made TEST.HSC using 0-7 Voices.
                       'and you wish to use channel 8 for effects!!

SetInst 8, 10          'Assume you've insert your desired instrument #10
                        in the HSCTracker I provided and you wish to set it
                        up at channel 8


DO
Playtune               'Always plays the music, has to be called constantly.
A$ = INKEY$
IF A$ = "1" THEN       'If key 1 pressed,
   Playnote 8, 50      'play pitch 50 at channel 8 (While the HSC is playing!)
END IF

IF A$ = "2" THEN       'If key 2 pressed,
   Playnote 8, 25      'play pitch 25 at channel 8 (While the HSC is playing!)
END IF

IF A$ = "3" THEN       'If key 3 pressed,
   Playnote 8, 77      'play pitch 77 at channel 8 (While the HSC is playing!)
END IF
IF A$ = CHR$(27) THEN  'If ESC is pressed, exit loop
   EXIT DO
ENDIF
LOOP

ResetFMChip 2          'Shuts off all voices!
