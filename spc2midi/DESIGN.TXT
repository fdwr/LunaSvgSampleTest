File
    Load...             opens dialog to choose spc/zst/zmv files to load
    Save...             saves current emulation state/header info to file

    Export wave
        Single selected exports the selected waveform to a file
        All together    exports all valid BRR samples to a large wave file
        All indidually  exports all valid BRR samples as separate files
    Log disassembly

Control
    Play                starts playing from buffer, emulating if necessary
    Pause               stops play without ending the recording
    Stop                stops play and ends any recording/logging
    Record              opens dialog to choose files to record to
    Reverse             reverses play direction
    Halt                temporarily halts play without silencing output
    Restart             resets emulation and sets position to beginning
    Loop                toggles loop on/off between two points
    Set loop start      marks current position as start of loop portion
    Set loop end        marks current position as end of loop portion
    Set start
    Set finish
    Find repeats        finds repeat sections after any intro and at repeat
Seek
    Time                goto typed position
    Front               jumps to front of buffer
    Start               jumps to beginning of buffer
    Loop start          jumps to start of loop portion
    Loop end            jumps to end of loop portion
    Finish              jumps to last important note
    Back                jumps to back of buffer
    Previous note       steps to end of note just before
    Next note           steps to beginning of very next note
    Previous marker     jumps back to previous marker
    Next marker         jumps forward to next marker
    Insert marker       quickly sets a marker at current position
    Delete marker       deletes marker closest to current position

Dialog Windows:

Sound Options
    FM Output           use FM synthesizer for sound output
    MIDI Output         use DSP for MIDI device output
    MPU Output          use MPU-401 port for output
    Sound Rate          Variable 5000-64000
    8bit/16bit

    All options can be changed without needing to restart the program. They
    can even be changed while sound is playing, with only a short click heard.
