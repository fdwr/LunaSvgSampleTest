; Message types
Msg:

; Messages:
;   Unlike Windows, which has thousands of messages, this simple GUI wouldn't
;   ever exceed 256. MS Windows has a message for every miscellanous thing,
;   while my GUI only has messages for things that really matter. So AL was
;   chosen as the message holder, leaving the remaining upper bits for
;   optional flags.

; Common messages vs Specific messages:
;   After much pondering, I finally decided to make common GUI messages start
;   from 0 upward and specific messages unique to a certain item start at -1
;   downward. Two other ideas included: making common messages 0-127 and
;   specific messages 128-255, or making specific messages a subset of common
;   messages with the specific message in AH. By making messages extend
;   either direction from zero, it simplifies message branching by not
;   needing to test the upper bit (128) and subtract 128, or two comparisons
;   (AL then AH), or even two jump tables. Instead (after byte sign extension)
;   there is one jump table and no extra comparisons (other than the range
;   checking which would have to be done in any case).

; Message order:
;   Messages are somewhat grouped by category, but are also arranged so that
;   that the most commonly used ones (specifically owner messages) are put
;   at either end of the range (close to 0 or close to 255), making the jump
;   tables smaller.

; Other messages to be added:
;
; Get item's effective flags, considering all container's flags
;   To get an item's effective flags, all of its container's flags are
;   combined with it. For example, if an item can receive key focus, but
;   its container can not, then that item's effective state is no key focus.
;   Similarly with visibility, if an item is visible, but its container is
;   not, truly neither is the item.
; Get item at row/column coordinate
;   This could used for getting help on an item. If you click on the
;   question mark on a title bar, and then move the cursor over an item,
;   the code would need to know which item is the cursor rests over. This
;   message could be sent directly to a window or from the top level with
;   a specified depth. It is very similar to SendMouseMsg.

;컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
; Key Focus:
;   Only one item have key focus at any given time in a container. Whether
;   or not the container itself currently has focus, there is always one item
;   that has active key focus item (unless the container has no items in it).
;   Individual items can be grouped, allowing each group to have its own
;   default item. Although only one item can actually be the active item and
;   receive key input, several items can be informed of focus changes and
;   even make themselves falsely appear active (as if they all simultaneously
;   had focus) when certain item flags are set.
;
; Common usage:
;   The next/previous item within a group
;   The next/previous group
;   A specific item/specific group
;   Changing the default item of a specific group
;
; Focus setting behaviour:
;   Focus be set to either a single item or whole group, relatively or
;   absolutely. Absolute setting can activate a specific item, or the group
;   that item is in. Relative setting seeks either forward or backward
;   relative the active item or to some other specified item. If the focus
;   change fails at some point, the routine will still continue and perform
;   other operations requested. For example, if both the item and group flags
;   were given but the specified item could not be set, it would still try to
;   set the group. If the container flag was given but any focus change
;   within the container failed, it would still active the container.
;
; Container/group/item flags:
;   These three flags combined in different ways tell the same function call
;   to perform focus changes in a variety of ways. When the item flags is
;   given, the active item of a specific group is set (the active group
;   remains unchanged). When the group flags is given, the active group is
;   changed (the active item of that group becomes the active item of the
;   container). To set an item both the active item of a group and the active
;   group, combine both flags. With the container flag set, the container is
;   activated.
;
; Splitting key input:
;   Since key focus can truly only belong to one item at a time, to split key
;   input between separate but closely paired items (like a list and text
;   prompt), an invisible item can be used to interpret keystrokes and then
;   pass them onto the correct item according the key pressed. For example, a
;   text prompt and list might be paired, so that all alphanumeric characters
;   are sent to the text prompt but up/down arrow keys are sent to the list.
;   The invisible item would truly be what had focus, but it would do nothing
;   more than receive the input and chain it.
;
;   The list and prompt would look though as if they had focus because they
;   are part of the same group and would have their item focus flags on.
;   Using a separate "invisible" item to do this might seem rather clumsy
;   and wasteful, but it's really more elegant than putting the equivalent
;   code in the owner for the container, and no slower because of the minimal
;   processing it does.

; An item need not have this entire structure if certain properties are
; unused (although it hurts only a few bytes to have them). For example, an

; will not use them if the Hidden flag is set. If an item is part of a really
; simple container (no zlayering or key focus), it doesn't need an index
; value. The other values should always be included, and the code address is
; absolutely essential.
;
; Focus Clarification:
;   Active focus is not synonymous with key or mouse focus. Each is
;   independant from the other, although one frequently causes another. For
;   example, mouse focus (moving the mouse over the item) may cause it to
;   grab item focus, which it follows by taking key focus.
;
;   Some items can not receive key input, but should still be alerted to focus
;   changes (like a title bar). So AllFocus is set for such an item. Focus
;   messages do not necessarily indicate that key input will be sent to
;   the item, but rather its container or one of the items in its group has
;   received focus. Only if all three flags are set off (reversed for simpler
;   testing) can the item assume that it is active.

;
; With merely a single pointer to owner code, this seemingly pointless, tiny
; structure was created to allow an item's owner to be either program code
; or another item. It is basically a GUI object without the object, only the
; code address (both are at offset -4).

; -there is a big difference between the menu object and the MenuList
;  structure. the structure is simply used by other objects. the menu object
;  is what interprets the mouse & key input and modifies the MenuList
;  variables accordingly.
; -each MenuList has a pointer to its open child (if it currently has one),
;  but no pointer to its parent, because retreating back up the menu chain
;  can be achieved by simply starting from the top of the heirarchy and going
;  down.
; -any changes can be made to a closed MenuList structure (like disabling,
;  hiding, changing the text of choices), but if the MenuList is currently
;  being shown/used in any menu object, that container menu must be informed
;  via message that one of its open MenuLists has been modified. That way, the
;  menu object can reformat/resize/redraw/reselect it as needed.
