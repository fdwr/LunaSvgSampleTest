Comment
{
Each exercise consists of at least two items, a title and text. The
text for those items are enclosed between curly brackets. To add more
exercises, just add these two items after the last one or between some.

Other items that can be included are:
Name -    for now is unused but is intended to uniquely identify a page.
Title -   title of exercise, seen above the text.
Image -   optional image that goes along with text
Sound -   wave file that holds a listing of the words
Comment - ignored by program, just meant for other people to read.
Text -    the actual exercise. Each cloze word (up to 12 per exercise) is
          enclosed in square brackets and will appear in a card below. The
          exercise text will automatically wrap if longer than the width,
          but you can also explicitly put line breaks in the exercise text
          if you need to. It is important that this be the last item in an
          exercise, since the program expects the next exercise to be
          immediately after it.

Text {To complete an exercise, simply grab the word and drop it into the sentence where it belongs. If the location is right, it will merge into the sentence, else it will jump back. If missed three times, the word will automatically float to where it belongs.

When no words are left, you can either retry the exercise, proceed to the next, or leave to the menu.

Try it now, by grabbing the word below and moving it ([here]).}

Text {Below are some more sample words. Note that you can use any word, multiple words, or puncuation. All blanks are set to the same size so that word length is not a clue. Also, all words are set to lower case to prevent the first word of sentence being too obvious. Finally, all the words are scrambled each time.

Single ([word]), Multiple ([two words]), Special ([Dr.]), Puncuation, ([;])}
