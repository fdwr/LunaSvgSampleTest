Well, i've made it to 128 bytes, and now the time has come to move on to
bigger and better things (heheh). Thanks to everyone who joined in and helped
out with optimization - i've learned a lot and i hope that this code can
teach people some neat size optimization tricks :)

Have fun and learn.
