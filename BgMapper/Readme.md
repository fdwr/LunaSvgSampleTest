âœ‹ There are better viewing programs out there now, like vSNES. This is an ancient (~1999) DOS utility in x86 asm to view ZSNES savestate scenes, and it's not actively updated anymore, but here's the source for those who asked. Should I clean it up more? Yes. Will I? Nope.

See [Project Page](http://pikensoft.com/programs-bgmapper.html) and [BgMapper.txt](doc/BgMapper.txt) for more.
