DWritEx is not associated with the official Microsoft DirectWrite in anyway, nor is it endorsed or supported by Microsoft. It is purely my own supplementary library for the Windows 7 DirectWrite that fills in a few convenience holes. You can essentially do whatever you want with it, except that if you modify and redistribute it, make it clear that you've forked it.

You may:
- Use the library in commercial and non-commercial projects without fee or even attribution.
- Modify the code in any way needed for your project without any requirement to disclose the changed code.
- Freely rip out only the needed sections of code into your project.
- Redistribute the library as-is on any media without asking (website, CD...).

You must:
- Clearly mark the library as being modified from the original if you redistribute a changed version.
- Not expect any support or compensation from possible defects in it. You have the code. Judge its quality for yourself. Liability is yours.

You should consider (but are not obligated to):
- If you do find a clear bug and found a fix, please tell me.
- If you added a feature, let me know what it was.
