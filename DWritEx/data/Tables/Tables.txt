# This is the control file for ucdtool.exe.  It specifies which properties
# to generate information for.
#
# There are two types of properties - Boolean and Enumeration.  Both types
# require the Type to be specified as well as the File and GeneratedType.
#
# Boolean properties also require the Category to be specified.  Typically
# Ucd files containing boolean properties have several different properties
# in a single file.  The Category disambiguates which one to generate for.  
# The generated header will contain a function named "UcdIs<GeneratedType>".
#
# Emumerated properties require the DefaultValue to be specified.  The
# generated header will contain an enum <GeneratedType> containing all the 
# values for that property as well as a function named "UcdGet<GeneratedType>".
# Enumerated properties may optionally specify a SymbolPrefix that is
# prepended to the value names listed in the enum.  If no SymbolPrefix is
# given than <GeneratedType> is used as the prefix.
#
# Value properties can be either hex or decimal (HexValue/DecimalValue),
# and require a DefaultValue in case one is not specified for the character.
# The generated function will will be named "UcdGet<GeneratedType>".
#
# Note that all attributes are case-sensitive.


# These first few attributes (before the first File attribute) are directives
# to ucdtool.  Note that the paths here assume that ucdtool is run from
# windows\core\text\data\tables.
